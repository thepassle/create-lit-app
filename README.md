## Get Started Immediately

![Lit Cli](http://thepassle.nl/SGTEST/cla.gif)

You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Clone/fork this repo or install the CLI if you want to get started quickly building a fullstack LitHTML app with:

* Routing
* Express api
* Redux
* Build with webpack


Do you **not** want to use webpack, and just use the Polymer CLI tools? Check out [this branch](https://github.com/thepassle/create-lit-app/tree/no-webpack)

## Quickstart

```sh
npm install --global create-lit-app
create-lit-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
```

## Start the development server

Start `webpack-dev-server` on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:3000`:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Run tests

Run tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Build with webpack

Run the production build:

```sh
npm run build
node server.js
```

As easy as that! Next you can upload it to heroku/digital ocean/whatever.
