## Get Started Immediately

You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Just clone the project, and you’re good to go. 
Clone/fork this repo if you want to get started quickly building a fullstack LitHTML app with:

* Routing
* Express api
* Redux
* Build with webpack


Do you **not** want to use webpack, and just use the Polymer CLI tools? Check out [this branch](https://github.com/thepassle/create-lit-app/tree/no-webpack)

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thepassle/create-lit-app.git
cd create-lit-app
npm i
npm run start
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

## Start the development server

Start `webpack-dev-server` on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:3000`:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Run tests

Run tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Build with webpack

Run the production build:

```sh
npm run build
node server.js
```

As easy as that! Next you can upload it to heroku/digital ocean/whatever.
