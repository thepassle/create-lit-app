Create-lit-app is something I put together after struggling to set up an app for a hobby project. Clone/fork this repo if you want to get started quickly building a fullstack LitHTML app with:

* Routing
* Express api
* Redux
* Build with webpack

I made this repo to make it easier for other people like me to get started making a LitHTML app.

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thepassle/create-lit-app.git
cd create-lit-app
npm i
npm run start
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

## Start the development server

Start `webpack-dev-server` on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:3000`:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Run tests

Run tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Build with webpack

Run the production build:

```sh
npm run build
node server.js
```

As easy as that! Next you can upload it to heroku/digital ocean/whatever.
